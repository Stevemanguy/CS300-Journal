# CS300-Journal

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I needed to design and compare data structures that could load, store, search, and print course information for a college advising program.

How did you approach the problem?
I looked at runtime and memory tradeoffs for vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. I picked the BST because it gave good balance between speed and keeping the data sorted.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Most issues came from parsing the file and making sure prerequisites worked. I fixed them by writing helper functions and checking for missing data before loading it into the tree.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
It made me think more about the end user’s needs, not just what’s easiest to code. I realized picking the right data structure makes a big difference for performance.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I added cleaner functions, kept comments simple, and made the code easier to read. That way it can be updated later without having to rework everything.
